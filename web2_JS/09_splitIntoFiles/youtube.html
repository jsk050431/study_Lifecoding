          YouTube is an American social media and online video sharing platform
          owned by Google. YouTube was founded on February 14, 2005, by Steve
          Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, three former employees of PayPal.
          Headquartered in San Bruno, California, it is the second-most-visited
          website in the world, after Google Search. In January 2024, YouTube
          had more than 2.7 billion monthly active users, who collectively
          watched more than one billion hours of videos every day. As of May
          2019, videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more
          than 500 hours of content per minute, and as of mid-2024, there were
          approximately 14.8 billion videos in total.
