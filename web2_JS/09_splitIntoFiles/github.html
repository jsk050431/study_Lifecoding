          GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to
          create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to provide
          distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control,
          bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous
          integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California,
          GitHub, Inc. has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018. It is
          commonly used to host open source software development projects. As of
          January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers and
          more than 420 million repositories, including at least 28 million
          public repositories. It is the world's largest source code host as of
          June 2023. Over five billion developer contributions were made to more
          than 500 million open source projects in 2024.
